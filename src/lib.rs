//! Introduction to the Rust programming language
//!
//! # What is Rust?
//!
//! Rust is a systems programming language with a focus on memory safety, thread safety and
//! correctness. More information on their [web page](https://www.rust-lang.org/).
//!
//! # Why rust
//!
//! Pros:
//!
//! - Minimal runtime
//! - Expressive type system
//! - Excellent toolchain
//! - A focus on catching errors at compile time rather than runtime
//! - Zero-cost abstractions
//! - Good documentation
//!
//!
//! Cons:
//!
//! - Steep learning curve
//! - Still relatively young:
//!   - Ecosystem
//!   - Toolchain
//! - Longer compile times
//!
//! # Toolchain
//!
//! Rust comes with a build tool named `cargo`, that does dependency, management, building, running,
//! test running, documentation generation and more.
